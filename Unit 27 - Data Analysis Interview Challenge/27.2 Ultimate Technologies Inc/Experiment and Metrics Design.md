# 1) What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?

The number of trips taken by driver partners that cross the toll bridge between the two cities. if drivers are indeed serving both cities, we would expect an increase in cross-city trips.

# 2) Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on:

<ul>
    <h2> a) how you will implement the experiment</h2>
        <ul>
        - Record the number of trips taken by driver that cross the toll bridge for a period of time before the reimbursement is offered.<br>
        - Record the number of trips taken by driver that cross the toll bridge for a period of time after the reimbursement is offered.<br>
        </ul>
    <h2> b) what statistical test(s) you will conduct to verify the significance of the observation</h2>
        <ul>
        A paired t-test can compare the means of cross-city trips before and after the toll reimbursement. A null hypothesis would be that the number of trips would not increase after the reimbursement.<br>
        </ul>
    <h2> c) how you would interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats.</h2>
        <ul>
        - Set a significance level of a = 0.05<br>
        - Calculate the t-statistic and p-value<br>
        - If the p-value is less than the significance level, then the null hypothesis can be rejected.<br>
        - If there is a significant increase in cross-city trips, continue the reimbursement policy. Otherwise, determine if there is another factor present disincentivizing drivers from crossing between the cities, i.e. communication or traffic. <br>
        - Ensure that data is collected for a sufficient period of time to account for any seasonal or holiday effects and continue to review periodic trip data is ensure reimbursement policy is a continued benefit. <br>
        </ul>
